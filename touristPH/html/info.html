        <div class="description1" data-aos="fade-left">
            <p>El Nido is a Philippine municipality on the island of Palawan. 
                It is well-known for its white-sand beaches, coral reefs, and as the entry point to the Bacuit archipelago, a collection of islands with steep karst cliffs. 
                Miniloc Island is well-known for the crystal-clear waters of its Small and Big lagoons. 
                Shimizu Island's waters are teeming with fish. 
                There are numerous dive sites in the area, including Dilumacad Island's long tunnel that leads to an underwater cavern.

                Siquijor is the Philippines' third-smallest province, located in Central Visayas. It is known as a mystic power center and the capital of mystic activities and black magic. Siquijor is well-known for its agimat and gayuma. Despite this, Siquijor has incredible sights and is quickly becoming one of the most popular tourist destinations in the Philippines.

            <h3>Coron</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="description3" data-aos="fade-left">
            <p>Coron is an excellent adventure base, particularly for underwater explorers looking to dive among the Japanese shipwrecks of the 1940s.
                There's more to Palawan than the world-famous El Nido islands and beaches, or the Puerto Princesa Underground River tours. Coron is a tropical island in the Philippine province of Palawan.
                Coron is an island group distinct from the main island of Palawan. The islands in this area are all part of the Calamian Archipelago in Northern Palawan. Coron, while frequently compared to El Nido, a popular Palawan destination, has its own distinct charm.

            <p>Bohol is the largest island in the province of Bohol, which also includes 75 smaller islands. In the Central Visayas region, the island is located southeast of Cebu Island and southwest of Leyte Island.
                The tenth largest island in the Philippine archipelago is this oval-shaped island.
                Bohol is a tropical natural beauty haven. The island's coastline is dotted with gentle coves and white sand beaches. Bohol is well-known locally as a diving and snorkeling paradise, though it is not as well-known internationally as Boracay.
                Dolphin and whale watching tours are popular among both residents and visitors. The best time to see dolphins is from March to June, but they can be seen all year.
                Bohol is well-known for its Chocolate Hills and tarsiers, which may be the world's smallest primate.

            <h3>Siargao</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="description5" data-aos="fade-left">
            <p>Siargao, a small teardrop-shaped island off Mindanao's northeastern coast, is known as the country's Surfing Capital and is one of the best tourist destinations in the Philippines.
                Conde Nast Traveler readers named Siargao the Best Island in the World in 2019.
                White sand beaches, picturesque islands, blue-green waters ideal for snorkeling and diving, waterfalls, lagoons, and caves are all available.
                The island also has delicious local and international cuisine to satisfy even the most discriminating palate.
                Travelers typically stay in General Luna for the surf spots, but Del Carmen is becoming increasingly popular due to the Sugba Lagoon.
